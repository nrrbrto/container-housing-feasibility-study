# Container Housing Analysis Project

## Overview

This project analyzes the feasibility of recycling shipping containers into sustainable housing options for urban development, primarily relating to a PH setting (wherever possible) with a focus on cost comparison, sustainability metrics, and practical implementation challenges. From a college analysis paper I made before, this project aims to be practice in data analytics, visualization, and research. Currently working with AI such as Claude and DeepSeek to streamline tasks and analysis, as well as learning and familiarizing myself again with coding.

Some parts are deliberately put just for practice (ex., produced a data set to clean but is unrelated to the analysis as a whole)
