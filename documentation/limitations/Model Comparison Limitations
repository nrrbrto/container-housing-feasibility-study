## Cost Calculation Breakdown

### Traditional Housing Cost Calculation
1. Contractor Rates (2024):
   - Ian Fulgar Construction:
     * Minimum: ₱25,000/sqm
     * Maximum: ₱29,000/sqm
     * Average: (₱25,000 + ₱29,000)/2 = ₱27,000/sqm
   - ACDC Contractors:
     * Rate: ₱32,000/sqm
   - Combined average: (₱27,000 + ₱32,000)/2 = ₱29,500/sqm
   - Total for 24 sqm unit: ₱29,500 × 24 = ₱708,000

2. Cost Components (based on industry standards):
   - Labor: 30% (CLMA industry average) = ₱212,400
   - Finishes: 35.8% (NAHB):
     * Internal finishes: 24%
     * External finishes: 11.8%
     * Total finishes: ₱253,464
   - Materials (remaining 34.2%): ₱242,136

### ODD Cubes Cost Breakdown
From ArchJosieDeAsisDP.pdf:
1. Base Components:
   - Livable unit cost: ₱360,000
   - Fenestration (6 cuts × ₱10,000): ₱60,000
   - Total cost: ₱420,000

2. Cost Components:
   - Materials (Base unit minus estimated finishes): ₱231,120
   - Labor (fenestration): ₱60,000
   - Finishes (35.8% of base unit): ₱128,880

## Container Specification Differences

### Arch Josie Study Model
- Uses 2 x Class C containers (20ft each)
- Total container cost: ₱78,000 (₱39,000 each)
- Modification costs: ₱10,000 per cut (ODD Cubes Inc. pricing)
- Multiple connection points needed between containers
- Total cuts required: 6 (4 windows + 2 doors)
- Total modification cost: ₱60,000

### Current Study Model
- Uses 1 x Class A 40ft HC container
- Single unit eliminates need for container joining
- Potentially fewer cuts required due to single unit
- May have reduced modification costs due to:
  * Fewer structural reinforcements needed
  * No inter-container connections
  * Potentially fewer total cuts
  * Higher quality container requiring less remedial work

## Finish Specifications

### Conceptual Base Model
- Minimum finish requirements
- Basic utilities package
- Standard insulation
- Basic ventilation
- Base budget allocation: ₱102,000

### Conceptual Maximum Model
- Enhanced comfort features
- Additional utilities
- Premium insulation options
- Higher quality finishes
- Additional budget allocation: ₱291,000
- Includes:
  * Utilities
  * Insulation
  * Additional finishes
  * Double walls
  * Other necessary alterations

## Cost Implication Notes

1. Container Quality Impact
   - Class A vs Class C pricing differential
   - Reduced maintenance requirements
   - Better structural integrity
   - Longer expected lifespan

2. Modification Efficiency
   - Single unit modifications vs double unit
   - Reduced labor requirements
   - Streamlined installation process
   - Potentially lower total modification cost

3. Finish Standardization
   - All base models maintain minimum standards
   - Consistent basic feature set across versions
   - Upgradeable design for future improvements
   - Standard utility configurations

## Research Gaps

1. Direct Cost Comparison Limitations
   - Different container classes (A vs C)
   - Different time periods
   - Market price variations
   - Labor cost changes

2. Modification Cost Uncertainties
   - Updated pricing needed for Class A modifications
   - Current market rates for structural work
   - Modern insulation costs
   - Contemporary finishing costs

3. Performance Data
   - Long-term durability comparison
   - Maintenance cost differences
   - Energy efficiency variations
   - Occupant comfort metrics
