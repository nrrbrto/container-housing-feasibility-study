# Container Housing Project Limitations

## 1. Geographic Limitations

### Location Constraints

- Limited to Manila outskirts only
- Justification:
  - Higher housing demand data availability
  - Proximity to shipping container sources
  - Lower land costs
  - Existing infrastructure connections
  - Better employment opportunities
  - More comprehensive urban development data

### Geographic Exclusions

- Other major cities not considered
- Rural areas not evaluated
- Different climate zones not analyzed

## 2. Housing Unit Specifications

### Occupancy Limitations

- Maximum family size: 4 people
- Room configuration: 2 bedrooms only
- No multi-family configurations considered

### Design Constraints

- Standard finish level only
- Basic utilities package only
- No custom modifications
- No multi-story configurations

## 3. Container Specifications

### Physical Limitations

- Size: 40ft High Ceiling (HC) container only
  - Fixed dimensions: 29.7mÂ² (320 sq ft)
  - Rectangular shape constraints
  - No structural modifications considered
- Type: Cargo Worthy (CW) classification only
- Used containers only (post-shipping life)
- No container stacking configurations

### Technical Constraints

- Standard ventilation systems only
- Basic insulation specifications
- Limited modification options

## 4. Data Limitations

### Price Data

- Limited to ship.com pricing data
- Time range: 2017-2024 only
- Single supplier perspective
- Limited market comparison data
- US port pricing used instead of Philippine pricing
- Geographic price translation required
- Currency conversion considerations
- Different market conditions between US and Philippines
- Limited to specific US port data (West Coast focus)
- Potential market variations between source locations

### Cost Analysis Gaps

- No local container home conversion cost data
- Limited utilities installation cost data
- Incomplete labor cost information
- Missing modification cost details

### Research Constraints

- Limited local case studies
- Minimal long-term performance data
- Limited failure rate statistics
- No occupant satisfaction data

## 5. Standard Finish Specifications

### Basic Inclusions

- Strategic window placement
- Basic ventilation design
- Standard roof extensions
- Basic moisture barriers
- Fundamental anti-corrosion treatment
- Basic flood elevation
- Standard electrical and plumbing

### Excluded Premium Features

- Advanced heat-reflective coatings
- Additional ventilation systems
- Premium anti-corrosion treatments
- Extended shade structures
- Advanced drainage systems
- Higher elevation structures

## 6. Price Translation Considerations

### US to Philippines Conversion Factors

- Exchange rate fluctuations
- Different labor market conditions
- Varied regulatory requirements
- Transportation cost differences
- Market size disparities
- Different economic conditions
- Local vs international pricing structures

### Market Adjustment Needs

- Cost of living differences
- Labor rate adjustments
- Local market conditions
- Supply chain variations
- Regulatory compliance costs
- Port handling fee differences
- Local transportation costs

### Price Estimation Methodology

- High ceiling container prices based on West Coast US data
- Base Philippine standard (40ft) container price: $2,175
- Applied 2.49% premium for high ceiling estimation
- Estimated Philippine high ceiling price: $2,229.05
- West Coast ports used due to:
  - Direct Asian trade routes
  - More relevant pricing patterns
  - Conservative premium estimation
- Price conversion limitations:
  - Market condition differences
  - Supply chain variations
  - Regional economic factors
- Validation needed for local market accuracy

### Notes

- Study limitations affect result generalizability
- Regular updates needed as market conditions change
- Additional local data would strengthen findings
- West Coast data preferred for Asian market relevance
