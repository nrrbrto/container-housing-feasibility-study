# Container Housing Analysis Project Notes

## Latest Updates

Last Updated: February 2, 2025

### Completed Components

- Adjusted PH price from data from shipped.com (40' HC CW)
- Traditional housing cost calculator
- Conceptual base and maximum prices
- Graphs for:
  - Total cost Comparison
  - Cost Breakdown Comparison
  - Cost per Square Meter:
  - Resource Usage Comparison (% of Traditional)

### Pending Tasks
- add voicenote summaries
- ROI
- Cost efficiency metrics
- Workflow-tree - mermaid
- Integration of sustainability metrics
- Scalability + Graph
- Efficiency Metrics + Graph
- Research progress dashboard - update
- Limitations - update
- Construction timeline comparisons
- Milanote WIP idea board

## To consider(?)

1. Sustainability analysis
2. Environmental impact metrics quantification

## Data Analysis practice (will probably make a separate git)

- Clean messy shipping data
- use container price changes - multiple views
- Use Containerized Freight index - possibly useless, or can pivot
